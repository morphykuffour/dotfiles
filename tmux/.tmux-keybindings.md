Note that the sticky window command (`w w`) allows one to execute all of the
above commands in the table but without the initial `w`. For example, after
hitting `w w`, `s l` splits the window pane to the right, `d` deletes the window
pane and so on (`q` exits the sticky command).

## Customization

### Custom keybindings

The option `@modal-keybindings-conf` can be set to load custom keybindings. The
file `keybindings.conf` shows the default keybindings and can be used as a
template. Thus, copy the file and modify it to your liking, and finally set this
in your `.tmux.conf` to load them:

```
set -g @modal-keybindings-conf /path/to/my-tmux-modal-keybindings.conf
```

### Yes/no prompt

Some commands might be too "dangerous" to execute directly, for example `w d`
(`kill-pane`) or `w D` (`kill-window`). The option `@modal-yesno-cmd` can
therefore be used to ask for confirmation before executing the commands (to
mimic the default tmux behavior). If you want a yes/no prompt before executing
these commands, put this in `.tmux.conf`:

```
set -g @modal-yesno-cmd on
```
